When a clattter came,
it was horses crossing the ford.
When the air creaked, it was
a lapwing seeing us off the premises
of its private marsh. A snuffling puff
ten yards from the boat was the tide blocking and
unblocking a holle in a rock.
When the black drums rolled, it was water
falling sixty feete into itself.
